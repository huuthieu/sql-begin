# Common SQL Patterns üìù

## 1. Top N per Group
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) as rn
  FROM products
) subq
WHERE rn <= N;
```

## 2. Running Total
```sql
SELECT *, SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as running_total
FROM sales;
```

## 3. Percentage of Total
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(amount) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(amount)) OVER () as percentage
FROM sales
GROUP BY category;
```

## 4. Year-over-Year Comparison
```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
  SUM(amount) as total
FROM sales
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date)
ORDER BY month, year;
```
